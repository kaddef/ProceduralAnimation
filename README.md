# Procedural Animation

The Procedural Animation project is an animation project created using the p5.js library. This project simulates the natural movements of creatures like snakes, fish, and lizard using a chain-based structure. It can be particularly useful for computer engineering enthusiasts and those interested in animation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the project's main content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the project.
- **JavaScript**: Used to control animations with the p5.js library.
- **p5.js**: A graphics and animation library used drawings in the project.

This project was inspired by a ["A simple procedural animation technique"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY) youtube video which explores similar concepts in procedural animation.
